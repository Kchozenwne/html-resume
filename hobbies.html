 <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
 <hr>

 <div>
  <h2>Coding</h2>
   <p>A hobby that I discovered in 2020. I enjoy building computer
     programs to solve problems and just for fun</p>
    </div> 
    
<div>
  <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>This is something that runs in the family. My uncles and my father
      used to draw a lot when I was a kid, and I guess I learnt that from them
      and I myself draw for fun
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div><h2>Gaming</h2>
   <p>
    I enjoy some casual gaming every now and then. My favorite games to play include
    Call of Duty, FIFA (or now called EA FC), and WWE 2K
   </p>

    <h2>Forex trading</h2>
   <p>
   It sounds weird, but I do enjoy forex trading as a hobby. While other people do it for 
   money (and to be honest, I do too), there's just something awesome about analyzing the 
   financial and stock market charts, as well as growing trading balances (even if its just demo accounts)
   It's like a rush. No wonder wall street looks the way it does haha 
   </p>
  </div>

  <div>  
    <h2>Solving mathematical problems</h2>
   <p>
    I'm mostly a numbers guy, hence my love for solving mathematical problems. 
    Whether it's derivatives, sequences and series, or even a little bit of Time Value of money
    calculations, crunching the numbers is something that I really enjoy.
   </p>
  </div>

 <div>
  <h2>Soccer/Football</h2>
   <p>
    I enjoy having a kick about with the boys, whether it's 5-a-side, or 11v11, 
    Playing football is one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy watching football. 
    My favorite football team is Chelsea FC, and my favorite players include Cole Palmer, 
    Cristiano Ronaldo, and Eden Hazard. 
   </p>

  <div>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
   <p>
    I enjoy reading the greatest book to ever exist: The Bible. I also enjoy reading self-help 
    books, as well as fiction books. My favorite books include the purpose-driven life by Rick Warren,
    Atomic habits by James Clear, and The Magic Factory by Morgan Blue
